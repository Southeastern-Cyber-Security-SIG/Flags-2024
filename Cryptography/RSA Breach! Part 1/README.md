# RSA Breach! Part 1
## Cryptography

Warning! You're a software security analyst with Amazon. You've been doing your normal daily activities when all of a sudden a huge alert came through. Your encryption algorithm that encrypts people's credit card information has corrupted and failed! Oh no, now all of the customers credit card information is viewable to outside sources. If you don't act soon, everyone's info will be available and Amazon will be in big trouble. You swiftly get to work and work on fixing the algorithm. Thankfully you get it back up and running quickly. As its almost finished encrypting everything again, the internet goes out. It only didn't get to the last four digits of one credit card and the internet won't be back up for hours. But you wrote the algorithm, you know the public key, the private key, the modulus, P, and Q! You can encrypt this by hand! Get to work and ask your coworker, Kody Chabaud, to show you the math in order to encrypt these last 4 digits and ensure everyone's info is kept safe. God Speed soldier o7. 
P = 181, Q = 109, b = 653, Modulus = P * Q. Given this info, encrypt the number 7056 by hand using RSA.
