# RSA Online:
## Cryptography

Your friends pulled a little prank on you. They took one of your files and encrypted it with RSA encryption. You don't really know which file it is so you're worried that its something important. Interestingly enough, they left you the public and private keys, maybe on purpose, maybe on accident. Well now you know that you can decrypt the file yourself. Do so and enter the contents of the file as the flag.
