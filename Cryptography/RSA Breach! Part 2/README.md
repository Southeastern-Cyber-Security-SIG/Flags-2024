# RSA Breach! Part 2
## Cryptography

You're a small time hacker working on breaking encryption schemas. You decided that you wanted to make it big, so you shoot for Amazon. After a lot of testing, you're able to get some information out of their algorithm. You found a P, Q, Modulus, and b value. Luckily you took Number Theory with Kent Neuerberg and know that Amazon uses the RSA algorithm for credit card information. Time to test the theory. You're gonna decrypt this number you found in their database and it should give you the last 5 digits of this random users credit card. Call up your good friend, Kody Chabaud, to help you remember about how the decrypting process work in the RSA by hand. *Strongly suggest doing RSA Breach Part 1 first as it's a good introduction before getting into the decrypting*
P = 181, Q = 109, b = 653, modulus = P * Q, y = 12457
