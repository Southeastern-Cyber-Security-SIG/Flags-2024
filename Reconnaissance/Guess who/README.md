# Guess who
## Reconnaissance

I just meet a cool guy the other day and want some information on him. For this string of flags I will nedd you to do some recon on James Hooker. If I remember correctly, he mentioned that he worked for a company that created CTFs world wide. Unfortunately, that is all I remember. 

To start, I need the name of the company he works for.
